Variable g:Element

Theorem (CyclicGroupGroups)
  C₁:Group
  Proof
    ● is an operation of C₁ by CyclicGroupGroupOperation
    e₀ is an identity element of C₁ by CyclicGroupGroupIdentityElement
    [C₁, ●, e₀, g] satisfies GroupInverseElements by CyclicGroupGroupInverseElements
  Therefore
    C₁:Group by Groups
