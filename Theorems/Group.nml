Variable g:Element

Theorem (CyclicGroupGroups)
  C₁:Group
  Proof
    ● is an operation of C₁ by CyclicGroupGroupOperation
    e₀ is an identity element of C₁ by CyclicGroupGroupIdentityElement
    g⁻¹, ●, g, e₀, C₁ satisfy InverseElements by CyclicGroupGroupInverseElements
  Therefore
    C₁:Group by Groups
