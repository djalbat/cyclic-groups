Lemma (CyclicGroupIdentityElementAlternativeForm)
  e₀ is an identity element of C₁
  Proof
    𝓮_C₁ is an identity element of C₁ by GroupIdentityElements
    e₀ = 𝓮_C₁ by CyclicGroupIdentityElement
  Therefore
    e₀ is an identity element of C₁

Lemma (CyclicGroupOperationAlternativeForm)
  ∙ is an operation of C₁
  Proof
    ∘_C₁ is an operation of C₁ by GroupOperations
    ∙ = ∘_C₁ by CyclicGroupOperation
  Therefore
    ∙ is an operation of C₁

Lemma (CyclicGroupElementAlternativeForm)
  e₀ is an element of C₁
  Proof
    e₀ is an identity element of C₁ by CyclicGroupIdentityElementAlternativeForm
  Therefore
    e₀ is an element of C₁ by GroupIdentityElementsAreElements
