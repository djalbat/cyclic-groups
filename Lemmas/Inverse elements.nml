Lemma (CyclidGroupInversesCanonicalForm)
  e₀ is an inverse of e₀
  Proof
    e₀ ∙ e₀ = e₀ by CyclicGroupLaw
    e₀ = e₀ ∙ e₀
    e₀ ∙ e₀ = e₀ = e₀ ∙ e₀ by DoubleEqualityIntroduction
    e₀ is an element of C₁ by CyclicGroupElementCanonicalForm
    ∙ is an operation of C₁ by CyclicGroupOperationsCanonicalForm
    e₀ is an identity element of C₁ by CyclicGroupIdentityElementsCanonicalForm
    e₀ is an inverse of e₀ iff [∙, e₀, e₀, e₀] satisfies GroupInverseDoubleEqualiy by GroupInverse
    [∙, e₀, e₀, e₀] satisfies GroupInverseDoubleEqualiy
  Therefore
    e₀ is an inverse of e₀ by BiconditionalImplicationRightElimination

Lemma (CyclidGroupInverses)
  Suppose
    g is an element of C₁
  Then
    g⁻¹ is an element of C₁
  Proof
    g = e₀ by CyclicGroupElementsAreEqual
    e₀ is an element of C₁ by CyclicGroupElementCanonicalForm
    ∙ is an operation of C₁ by CyclicGroupOperationsCanonicalForm
    e₀ is an identity element of C₁ by CyclicGroupIdentityElementsCanonicalForm
    e₀⁻¹ is an inverse of e₀ by GroupInverseCanoicalForm
    e₀ is an inverse of e₀ by CyclidGroupInversesCanonicalForm
    e₀ = e₀⁻¹ by GroupInversesAreUnique
    g = g⁻¹
  Therefore
    g⁻¹ is an element of C₁
