Lemma (CyclidGroupInversesCanonicalForm)
  𝘦₀ is an inverse of 𝘦₀
  Proof
    𝘦₀ ∙ 𝘦₀ = 𝘦₀ by CyclicGroupLaw
    𝘦₀ = 𝘦₀ ∙ 𝘦₀
    𝘦₀ ∙ 𝘦₀ = 𝘦₀ = 𝘦₀ ∙ 𝘦₀ by DoubleEqualityIntroduction
    𝘦₀ is an element of 𝘊₁ by CyclicGroupElementCanonicalForm
    ∙ is an operation of 𝘊₁ by CyclicGroupOperationsCanonicalForm
    𝘦₀ is an identity element of 𝘊₁ by CyclicGroupIdentityElementsCanonicalForm
    𝘦₀ is an inverse of 𝘦₀ 𝘪𝘧𝘧 [∙, 𝘦₀, 𝘦₀, 𝘦₀] satisfies GroupInverseDoubleEqualiy by GroupInverse
    [∙, 𝘦₀, 𝘦₀, 𝘦₀] satisfies GroupInverseDoubleEqualiy
  Therefore
    𝘦₀ is an inverse of 𝘦₀ by BiconditionalImplicationRightElimination

Lemma (CyclidGroupInverses)
  Suppose
    g is an element of 𝘊₁
  Then
    g⁻¹ is an element of 𝘊₁
  Proof
    g = 𝘦₀ by CyclicGroupElementsAreEqual
    𝘦₀ is an element of 𝘊₁ by CyclicGroupElementCanonicalForm
    ∙ is an operation of 𝘊₁ by CyclicGroupOperationsCanonicalForm
    𝘦₀ is an identity element of 𝘊₁ by CyclicGroupIdentityElementsCanonicalForm
    𝘦₀⁻¹ is an inverse of 𝘦₀ by GroupInverseCanoicalForm
    𝘦₀ is an inverse of 𝘦₀ by CyclidGroupInversesCanonicalForm
    𝘦₀ = 𝘦₀⁻¹ by GroupInversesAreUnique
    g = g⁻¹
  Therefore
    g⁻¹ is an element of 𝘊₁
