Lemma (CyclicGroupClosure)
  Suppose 
    g is an element of C₁
    h is an element of C₁
  Then
    g ● h is an element of C₁
  Proof
    g is an element of C₁ iff g = e₀ by CyclicGroupElement
    g is an element of C₁
    g = e₀ by BiconditionalImplicationLeftElimination
    h is an element of C₁ iff h = e₀ by CyclicGroupElement
    h is an element of C₁
    h = e₀ by BiconditionalImplicationLeftElimination
    e₀ is an element of C₁ by CyclicGroupSingleElement
    e₀ ● e₀ = e₀ by CyclicGroupOperation
    e₀ ● e₀ is an element of C₁
  Therefore
    g ● h is an element of C₁

Lemma (CyclicGroupAssociativity)
  Suppose 
    f is an element of C₁
    g is an element of C₁
    h is an element of C₁
  Then
    f ● (g ● h) = (f ● g) ● h = f ● g ● h
  Proof
    f is an element of C₁ iff f = e₀ by CyclicGroupElement
    f is an element of C₁
    f = e₀ by BiconditionalImplicationLeftElimination
    g is an element of C₁ iff g = e₀ by CyclicGroupElement
    g is an element of C₁
    g = e₀ by BiconditionalImplicationLeftElimination
    h is an element of C₁ iff h = e₀ by CyclicGroupElement
    h is an element of C₁
    h = e₀ by BiconditionalImplicationLeftElimination
    e₀ ● e₀ = e₀ by CyclicGroupOperation
    g ● h = e₀ ● e₀
    g ● h = e₀
    f ● (g ● h) = e₀ ● e₀
    f ● (g ● h) = e₀
    f ● g = e₀ ● e₀
    f ● g = e₀
    (f ● g) ● h = e₀ ● e₀
    (f ● g) ● h = e₀
    f ● g ● h = e₀ ● e₀ ● e₀
    f ● g ● h = e₀ ● e₀
    f ● g ● h = e₀
    f ● (g ● h) = (f ● g) ● h
    (f ● g) ● h = f ● g ● h
  Therefore
    f ● (g ● h) = (f ● g) ● h = f ● g ● h by DoubleEqualityIntroduction

Lemma (CyclicGroupGroupOperation)
  ● is an operation of C₁
  Proof
    ●, C₁ satisfy GroupClosure by CyclicGroupClosure
    ●, C₁ satisfy GroupAssociativity by CyclicGroupAssociativity
    ●, C₁ satisfy GroupClosure ∧ ●, C₁ satisfy GroupAssociativity by ConjunctionIntroduction
    ● is an operation of C₁ iff (●, C₁ satisfy GroupClosure ∧ ●, C₁ satisfy GroupAssociativity) by Operations
    ●, C₁ satisfy GroupClosure ∧ ●, C₁ satisfy GroupAssociativity
  Therefore
    ● is an operation of C₁ by BiconditionalImplicationRightElimination
