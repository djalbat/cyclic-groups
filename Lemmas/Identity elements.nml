Variable g:Element

Lemma (CyclicGroupIdentity)
  Suppose 
    g is an element of C₁
  Then
    g ∙ e₀ = g = e₀ ∙ g
  Proof
    g is an element of C₁ iff g = e₀ by CyclicGroupElement
    g is an element of C₁
    g = e₀ by BiconditionalImplicationLeftElimination
    e₀ ∙ e₀ = e₀ by CyclicGroupLaw
    e₀ = e₀ ∙ e₀
    e₀ ∙ e₀ = e₀ = e₀ ∙ e₀ by DoubleEqualityIntroduction
  Therefore
    g ∙ e₀ = g = e₀ ∙ g

Lemma (CyclicGroupIdentityElementsCanonicalForm)
  e₀ is an identity element of C₁
  Proof
    ∘_C₁ is an operation of C₁ by CyclicGroupOperations
    ∙ = ∘_C₁ by CyclicGroupOperation
    ∙ is an operation of C₁
    e₀ is an identity element of C₁ iff [C₁, ∙, e₀] satisfies GroupIdentity by GroupIdentityElement
    [C₁, ∙, e₀] satisfies GroupIdentity by CyclicGroupIdentity
  Therefore
    e₀ is an identity element of C₁ by BiconditionalImplicationRightElimination

Lemma (CyclicGroupIdentityElements)
  𝓮_C₁ is an identity element of C₁
  Proof
    e₀ is an identity element of C₁ by CyclicGroupIdentityElementsCanonicalForm
    e₀ = 𝓮_C₁ by CyclicGroupIdentityElement
  Therefore
    𝓮_C₁ is an identity element of C₁
