Lemma (CyclicGroupIdentity)
  Suppose 
    g is an element of 𝘊₁
  Then
    g ∙ 𝘦₀ = g = 𝘦₀ ∙ g
  Proof
    g is an element of 𝘊₁ 𝘪𝘧𝘧 g = 𝘦₀ by CyclicGroupElement
    g is an element of 𝘊₁
    g = 𝘦₀ by BiconditionalImplicationLeftElimination
    𝘦₀ ∙ 𝘦₀ = 𝘦₀ by CyclicGroupLaw
    𝘦₀ = 𝘦₀ ∙ 𝘦₀
    𝘦₀ ∙ 𝘦₀ = 𝘦₀ = 𝘦₀ ∙ 𝘦₀ by DoubleEqualityIntroduction
  Therefore
    g ∙ 𝘦₀ = g = 𝘦₀ ∙ g

Lemma (CyclicGroupIdentityElementsCanonicalForm)
  𝘦₀ is an identity element of 𝘊₁
  Proof
    ∘_𝘊₁ is an operation of 𝘊₁ by CyclicGroupOperations
    ∙ = ∘_𝘊₁ by CyclicGroupOperation
    ∙ is an operation of 𝘊₁
    𝘦₀ is an identity element of 𝘊₁ 𝘪𝘧𝘧 [𝘊₁, ∙, 𝘦₀] satisfies GroupIdentity by GroupIdentityElement
    [𝘊₁, ∙, 𝘦₀] satisfies GroupIdentity by CyclicGroupIdentity
  Therefore
    𝘦₀ is an identity element of 𝘊₁ by BiconditionalImplicationRightElimination

Lemma (CyclicGroupIdentityElements)
  𝓮_𝘊₁ is an identity element of 𝘊₁
  Proof
    𝘦₀ is an identity element of 𝘊₁ by CyclicGroupIdentityElementsCanonicalForm
    𝘦₀ = 𝓮_𝘊₁ by CyclicGroupIdentityElement
  Therefore
    𝓮_𝘊₁ is an identity element of 𝘊₁
