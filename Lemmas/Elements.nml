Lemma (CyclicGroupLaw)
  e₀ = e₀ ∙ e₀
  Proof
    ∙ is an operation of C₁ by CyclicGroupOperationAlternativeForm
    e₀ is an identity element of C₁ by CyclicGroupIdentityElementAlternativeForm
    e₀ is an element of C₁ by CyclicGroupElementAlternativeForm
    e₀ ∙ e₀ = e₀ = e₀ ∙ e₀ by GroupCompositionWithIdentityElements
  Therefore
    e₀ = e₀ ∙ e₀ by DoubleEqualityLeftElimination
